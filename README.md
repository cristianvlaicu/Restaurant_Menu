# What is this app? 

With this app, we can scan a QR code, and it will open a web page where there is a menu with different dishes and prices. The customer can watch that menu and see the disponibility of the products. The
admin, us, can se all data, modify it and choose among options on the administrator page. 

The app is made with Django tools, HTML for templates and Python for additional codes to make run the web page as we want.
